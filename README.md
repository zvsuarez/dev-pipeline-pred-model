# Development Pipeline for Life Expectancy Predictive Model

Files are numbered as following:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis - Exploring the distribution, skewness, and nature of features
2. Feature Selection - Selecting the most viable features using various confluences (`Variable Inflation Factor`, `Feature Importance Score`, `Permutation Importance`, `SHAP`, `Partial Dependence`)
3. Transformation Tests - Testing the results of appropriate transformers on features both built-in and custom
4. Cross Validation + Hyperparameter Tuning + Model Training/Evaluation - Validating viable models and tuning hyperparameters for optimal training and evaluation
